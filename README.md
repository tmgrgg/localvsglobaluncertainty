This is my master's research project, supervised by Hippolyt Ritter and David Barber at the UCL Centre for AI. I am currently working on an video to explain what the project was about and what I did. If you're reading this, it's not ready yet :( - In the meantime, I recommend reading the introductory chapter of my report (report_localglobal.pdf) to get a high-level idea.
